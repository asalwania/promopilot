# PromoPilot

Agentic retail promotion planner for the ET AI Hackathon (Problem 3, Retail: Autonomous Promotion Planner). A planning brief in plain English becomes a promotion plan that respects inventory, margin and budget constraints, with every number coming from deterministic tools and a human approving the result.

> **Status:** epic E0 (bootstrap). The API serves `/health` and the web app shows it. Planning features arrive in later epics; see [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) §15 for the delivery plan.

## Quickstart

Prerequisites: Docker, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Node 24 with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 11, GNU make. On Windows, run `make` from **Git Bash**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asalwania/promopilot.git
cd promopilot
make setup   # creates .env from .env.example, installs backend + frontend deps, git hooks
make dev     # Postgres in Docker; API on :8000 and web on :3000 with hot reload
```

Open http://localhost:3000. The home page calls the API's `/health` and shows the database status.

To run the full stack in containers with only Docker installed:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build --wait   # or: make up
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make setup` | Install dependencies and pre-commit hooks |
| `make dev` | Postgres in Docker; API and web natively with hot reload |
| `make up` / `make down` | Full stack (postgres, api, web) in Docker |
| `make test` | Backend + frontend unit/API tests (no Docker, no LLM) |
| `make test-integration` | Backend tests against a throwaway Postgres (testcontainers) |
| `make test-e2e` | Playwright against a running stack |
| `make lint` / `make format` | ruff, ESLint, Prettier |
| `make typecheck` | mypy strict, tsc strict |
| `make api-types` | Export OpenAPI to `docs/openapi.json` and regenerate frontend types |
| `make data`, `make train`, `make eval`, `make demo` | Arrive in epics E2, E4, E9, E11 |

## API

| Method | Path | Response |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | Always `200` while the process runs. `{"status": "ok" \| "degraded", "version", "checks": {"database": "ok" \| "error", "model_registry": "not_initialised"}}` |
